# ðŸ“ˆ Cramer's rule applied to system visualized

This project demonstrates Cramer's Rule in a **3D coordinate system**. Using Matplotlib, this project plots three planes in 3D space, showing how they intersect at a single point, effectively visualizing the solution to a linear system of three equations.
## âœ¨ Features:
- 3D Visualization: Plots three planes using different colors for clear differentiation.
- Equation Labels: Each plane is clearly labeled with its equation in the format:

$$
Plane : ax + by + cz = d
$$

- Intersection Highlighting: Marks and labels the exact point where the planes intersect.
- Dynamic Input: Reads system coefficients from a CSV file (input.csv) for flexible testing of different systems.

## ðŸŽ¯ Future Improvements:
 - Highlighting the lines where each pair of planes intersects.
 - Adding support for dynamic input and better error handling.
